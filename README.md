# The Monty Hall problem â€“ a frequentist explanation


### If we consider all the cases, we can observe that there are four potential outcomes:

- Case 1: You choose the [correct door] and decide to stay (win)
- Case 2: You choose the [correct door] and decide to switch (loss)
- Case 3: You choose the [wrong door] and decide to stay (loss)
- Case 4: You choose the [wrong door] and decide to switch (win)

---

### The probability of winning and losing as a whole is given by:

- Win %: (number of wins * 100.0 / total number of games)
- Loss %: (number of losses * 100.0 / total number of games)

#### So, the outcome will be the same: winning at 50% and losing at 50%.
---

### However, if we divide the win cases into stay and switch:

- Stay and win %: (stay_win * 100.0 / number of wins)
- Switch and win %: (switch_win * 100.0 / number of wins)
#### We can see that the probability of winning is higher if we switch, as plotted below:
---
- Win: 50.01%
- Loss: 49.99%
---
- Stay and win: 66.69%
- Switch and win: 33.31%
